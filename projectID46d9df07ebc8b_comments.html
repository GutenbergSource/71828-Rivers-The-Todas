<HTML><BODY><pre>Missing the last couple pages of the index, plus the genealogical tables
mentioned in the TOC.  The Google version might work for the index (though
the quality isn't good) but not the family trees.

I will be adding these from scans of my own copy, which has them complete. Note
that there are a lot of (sometimes wide) pages with family trees, and these will 
probably handled best as illustrations.

<p>The Todas, by W.H.R. Rivers is a classic in anthropology. It set new standards in the way anthropologists work, and in the depth of its coverage - a far cry from the much shorter ethnological descriptions made before him, and a precursor of people such as Malinowsky.

<p>The work deals with the Toda people of Southern India in detail.

<p>The work contains a large number of accented words in the Toda language. Please supply the accents if the OCR has missed them, and use the wordcheck interface to suggest them, such that the correct (if needed accented version) can appear in the good word list. 

<p>Due to the way Google processes its scans, the illustrations are replaced by white gaps. Please still indicate them as [Illustration].

<p>For ten years, this work has been waiting on my bookshelf to be scanned, but, being costly and heavy I was hesitating to sacrifice it to the scanner. Now Google has scanned it, and I could easily fix the few missing, obscured and blurred pages from my copy.
